Spot Trot Helpers
=================

Overview
--------

This repository hosts various Objective-C helper classes and categories that were created to assist in the development of [Spot Trot](http://www.spottrot.com/) iPhone applications.

Currently, the following custom classes are available:

-   **`STPickerView`**: This is a subclass of *`UIPickerView`* that easily allows you to create slide-up/slide-down picker views similar to those found in Mobile Safari.

`STPickerView` was created because `UIPickerView` does not naturally facilitate picker views that can be easily shown (slide-up) and hidden (slide-down) without manually implementing view hiding.
